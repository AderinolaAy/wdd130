            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>The White Water Rafting was founded in 1943 to provide rafting services, the company embark on a mandate that
            <br>decided that corporate world couldn't compete with the call of the canyon. With nothing but a beat-up truck and a few surplus
            <br>military rafts, White Water Rafting was born. We spent our first seasons camping on the riverbanks and learning every eddy and 
            <br>rock by heart. Today, we've traded the old gear for state of the art Inflatable Technology, but that same raw love for the water still
            <br>drives every trip we lead. We've seen the river change through seasons and decades, but our mission remains the sames: to share the 
            <br>Culture and Natural Resources of our home with explorers like you. 
            </p>
